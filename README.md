# 2048 Windows Form Game

Welcome to the 2048 Windows Form game! 
This project is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle game using C# and Windows Forms.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The goal of the game is to combine tiles with the same number to reach the 2048 tile.
2. **Controls**: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles in the corresponding direction.
3. **Tile Movement**: When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with their sum.
4. **Game Over**: The game is over when there are no more possible moves left.
